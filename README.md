# Guessing_Game
This is a small number guessing game

Here we ask user to select the level of difficulty, If he chooses easy user will get 10 chances, or if he chooses hard he will get 5 chances.

We generate a random number between 1 - 100, and ask the user to guess that number.
If user guesses it right it will stop the game. 
If the user guesses a number higher than the generated number, it will suggest the user decrease their guess. Otherwise, it will ask the user to increase their guess.
